# Unix Shell Project

## Overview
This project is a custom Unix shell developed as a subset of bash. It's designed to demonstrate essential shell functionalities and process management in Unix environments.

## Features
- Mimics key functionalities of the bash shell.
- Implements system calls such as `fork()`, `exec()`, and `waitpid()` for process management.
- Uses `dup2()` for I/O redirection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unix-based operating system (Linux, macOS)
- GCC or another C compiler

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Compile the shell:
3. Run the shell:
   
./unix_shell


## Usage
Execute commands as you would in a typical bash environment, within the limits of the implemented functionalities.

### Supported Commands
- Basic bash commands (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`)
- Process management commands using `&`, `fg`, etc.
- I/O redirection commands using `>` and `<`
